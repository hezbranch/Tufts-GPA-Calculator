# Tufts GPA Calculator 

This program runs in terminal for users to calculate their GPA. 

Currently, semester GPA cannot be calculated for Tufts students until official grades are submitted via SIS.

With this tool, students can "what-if" their grades during the covid-19 pandemic.

Students can use this tool to decide if they should use the "Exceptional Pass-Fail" policy for the semester.
